- **Here's an explanation of the code in terms of encapsulation:**

  **Encapsulated Attributes:**

  - **Protected Attributes:** All attributes (`_user_id`, `_username`, `_email`, `_password`, `_is_authenticated`) are prefixed with an underscore (`_`), signifying their intended internal use and discouraging direct access from outside the class. This creates a layer of protection around sensitive data.

  **Controlled Access with Getters and Setters:**

  - Getter Methods:
    - `get_username()`: Retrieves the user's username.
    - `get_email()`: Retrieves the user's email.
    - `get_id()`: Retrieves the user's ID.
    - `is_authenticated()`: Checks the user's authentication status.
  - Setter Method:
    - `set_email(new_email)`: Updates the user's email, allowing controlled modification of the attribute.

  **Encapsulation in Action:**

  - **Authentication:** The `authenticate(self, entered_password)` method encapsulates the logic for checking the user's password, protecting sensitive credentials and managing authentication state internally.
  - **Displaying Information:** The `display_info(self)` method respects encapsulation by using getters to access attributes, ensuring controlled access and potential validation even for information presentation.

  **Benefits:**

  - **Data Protection:** Encapsulation prevents accidental or malicious modification of user data.
  - **Modular Code:** The class becomes a self-contained unit with clear interfaces, making it easier to manage and reuse.
  - **Flexibility:** Changes to internal data structures or logic can be made without affecting external code that interacts with the class.

  **Additional Considerations:**

  - **Error Handling:** While not explicitly shown in this code, robust error handling within methods can further enhance data integrity and prevent unexpected issues.
  - **Type Hints:** Using type hints can improve code readability and type checking, making it easier to understand and maintain.
  - **Class Attributes:** If applicable, utilizing class attributes can provide a way to share data across all instances of the class.
  - **Inheritance:** Inheritance can be used to create specialized user types with additional functionality, leveraging the base class's encapsulated attributes and methods.
