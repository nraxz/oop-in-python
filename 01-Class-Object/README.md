**Class Definition:**

- **`class User:`** defines a class called `User`, which acts as a blueprint for creating objects representing users in the system.

  

**Constructor (`__init__()`):**

- `__init__(self, user_id, username, email):`

   is a special method called the constructor,

   responsible for initializing new 

  ```
  User
  ```

  - `self`: Refers to the current object being created.
  - `user_id`, `username`, `email`: Arguments passed to the constructor for setting up the object's attributes.
  - `self.user_id = user_id`: Assigns the provided `user_id` to the object's `user_id` attribute.
  - `self.username = username`: Assigns the provided `username` to the object's `username` attribute.
  - `self.email = email`: Assigns the provided `email` to the object's `email` attribute.

**Method (`display_info()`):**

- `display_info(self):`:

   Defines a method within the 

  ```
  User
  ```

   class to display the user's information:

  - It uses f-strings to format the output, including the object's attributes.

**Creating a User Object:**

- **`user1 = User(123, "johndoe", "johndoe@example.com")`**: Creates a new instance of the `User` class called `user1`, passing the required arguments to the constructor. This initializes the object's attributes with the provided values.

**Calling the Method on the Object:**

- **`user1.display_info()`**: Calls the `display_info()` method on the `user1` object, which prints the object's user ID, username, and email address to the console.

**Key Points:**

- **Classes:** Serve as blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes (data) and methods (behaviors).
- **Objects:** Instances of classes, each with their own unique set of attribute values.
- **Attributes:** Store information about an object's state.
- **Methods:** Define actions that an object can perform.
- **Self:** Refers to the current object within a method, allowing access to its attributes and methods.
- **Constructor (`__init__()`):** Special method called automatically when a new object is created, used for initializing the object's attributes.
